`This paper is created by Face++ and the method named EAST is a mainstream way to detect scene text. Actually, I spend more time to relize this paper then write this note.`

### Abstract

> However, they usually fall short when dealing with challenging scenarios, even when equipped with deep neural network models, because the overall performance is determined by the interplay of multiple stages and components in the pipelines.

Author think that scene text detection hac make great progress this years via deep networks. However, they usually fall short when dealing with challenging scenarios due to multiple stages and complex structure.

> In this work, we propose a simple yet powerful pipeline that yields fast and accurate text detection in natural scenes. The pipeline directly predicts words or text lines of arbitrary orientations and quadrilateral shapes in full images, eliminating unnecessary intermediate steps.

Author show what he do in this paper and do some work on designing loss functions and architecture. The final results show EAST performs well both in accuracy and efficiency.

### Introduction

Author show the evolution of scene text detection and propose a two stages network which performs well.

Author list three contributions of his work:

>- We propose a scene text detection method that consists of two stages: a Fully Convolutional Network and an NMS merging stage. The FCN directly produces text regions, excluding redundant and time-consuming intermediate steps.
>- The pipeline is flexible to produce either word level or line level predictions, whose geometric shapes can be rotated boxes or quadrangles, depending on specific applications.
>- The proposed algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed.

In my view:

- two stage networks
- flexible pipeline
- performs well both in accuracy and speed

### Methodology

`inportant`

I think if realize the fig you can realize most of EAST.

![EAST_overall_structure](/images/posts/EAST_overall_structure.png)

We can see clearly that there parts in the networks. First one is to extarct features and second one is to merge muitl-scale features. And the last one is to output the score map/RBOX/QUAD.

At the same time, author also show the details about loss function.

- loss for score map
- loss for RBOX
- loss for QUAD

At last, author proposed a NMS method named Locality-Aware NMS to solve the complex computation of standard NMS.

And if you want to konw the details, you can read the paper or [目标检测之非极大值抑制(NMS)各种变体](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/50126479)

### Experiments

Because this paper published in 2017, so I leave out this section.

### Conclusion and Future

I focus on the future:

>(1) adapting the geometry formulation to allow direct detection of curved text;
>(2) integrating the detector with a text recognizer;
>(3) extending the idea to general object detection.

Though 2 years passed, we still work on these directions.
